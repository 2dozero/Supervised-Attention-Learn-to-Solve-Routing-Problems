# Attention, Learn to Solve Routing Problems!

Attention based model for learning to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), Orienteering Problem (OP) and (Stochastic) Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP). Training with REINFORCE with greedy rollout baseline.

## Dependencies

* Python>=3.8
* NumPy
* SciPy
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)>=1.7
* tqdm
* [tensorboard_logger](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/tensorboard_logger)
* Matplotlib (optional, only for plotting)

### To run baselines
Baselines for different problems are within the corresponding folders and can be ran (on multiple datasets at once) as follows
```bash
python -m problems.tsp.tsp_baseline farthest_insertion data/tsp/tsp20_test_seed1234.pkl data/tsp/tsp50_test_seed1234.pkl data/tsp/tsp100_test_seed1234.pkl
```
To run baselines, you need to install [Compass](https://github.com/bcamath-ds/compass) by running the `install_compass.sh` script from within the `problems/op` directory and [Concorde](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html) using the `install_concorde.sh` script from within `problems/tsp`. [LKH3](http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH-3/) should be automatically downloaded and installed when required. To use [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com), obtain a ([free academic](http://www.gurobi.com/registration/academic-license-reg)) license and follow the [installation instructions](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_windows/installing_the_anaconda_py.html).

### Other options and help
```bash
python run.py -h
python eval.py -h
```

### Example CVRP solution
See `plot_vrp.ipynb` for an example of loading a pretrained model and plotting the result for Capacitated VRP with 100 nodes.
